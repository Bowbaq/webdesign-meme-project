\label{par:the_concept}
This website will allow users to contribute \enquote{Knock knock jokes} in text form. This meme would be accessible by anyone with a basic understanding of English. 

There is essentially two variable parts in the joke : the \enquote{who} and the \enquote{punchline}. Additionally, some knock knock jokes are comprised of several knock knock jokes, such as in the banana / orange joke. Thus a joke is composed of a \enquote{who} block and then either a \enquote{punchline} block or another knock knock joke.
